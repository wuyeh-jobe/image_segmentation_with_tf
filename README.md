# Image Segmentation with U-Net and Transfer Learning

Image segmentation has wide-ranging applications in computer vision. From scene understanding in autonomous driving to medical imaging, down to photo editing (use cases that have gained remarkable traction over the years), image segmentation is one of the most significant aspects of computer vision. Yet, it is a daunting challenge primarily because of the dynamism of images. Thus, there is not a one-size-fits-all algorithm for image segmentation. Nevertheless, the increase performance of computers heralded new ways of tackling image segmentation, such as deep learning, which have produced remarkable results. U-Net is a convolutional neural network that was developed for medical imaging. It has become popular for other tasks because of the possibility to modify it and train with less training data for better results over traditional image segmentation techniques. In this project, we train the U-Net model on new training samples, and applied data augmentation to improve the accuracy results.
